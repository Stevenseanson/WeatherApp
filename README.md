# WeatherApp

## Description

The academic purpose of the weather app is to demonstrate a knowledge of server side APIS and javascript, utilizing all components we've learned so far. The functional purpose is to tell the weather in any city written in the search bar. 

## Functionality

The search bar will show the 5 most recent cities, replacing the oldest one with the newest. If nothing is written but the search button is clicked, a blank button will appear, something I didn't have time to figure my way around. Also there are small CSS issues here and there like lining up the "5 Day Forecast" with the above div and fitting "Wind Chill" into the cards. I have made a note of this on the JS however.
